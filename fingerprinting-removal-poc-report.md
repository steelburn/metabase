# Fingerprinting Removal POC Report

## Summary of Changes

This POC disables data sampling for fingerprinting while preserving and properly applying metadata-based classifiers like the name classifier.

## Modified Files

1. `src/metabase/analyze/fingerprint/fingerprinters.clj`
   - Modified `fingerprint-fields` to return minimal fingerprints without any data sampling
   - No data will be fetched from the database for generating fingerprints

2. `src/metabase/sync/analyze/fingerprint.clj`
   - Modified `fingerprint-fields!` to directly apply name-based classification to fields
   - Updates the database with semantic types based on field names
   - Logs applied classifications for debugging
   - No data sampling occurs
   - Modified `refingerprint-fields-for-db!` to do nothing and return empty stats
   - Modified `refingerprint-field` to skip refingerprinting individual fields

3. `src/metabase/sync/task/sync_databases.clj`
   - Modified `should-refingerprint-fields?` to always return false, disabling refingerprinting at the scheduler level

## Impact Analysis

### Still Working
- Name-based classification via `metabase.analyze.classifiers.name/infer-semantic-type-by-name`
  - Fields named "email" will be classified as :type/Email
  - Fields named "created_at" will be classified as :type/CreationDate/CreationTimestamp
  - Fields named "zip_code" will be classified as :type/ZipCode
  - All patterns in `pattern+base-types+semantic-type` are applied
- Field and table metadata sync
- Other metadata-based operations

### No Longer Working
- Data fingerprinting statistics (values like min/max/avg for numbers, distinct count for fields)
- Histogram generation for numeric fields
- Automatic field analysis based on actual data values (beyond name-based classification)
- Periodic refingerprinting

## Testing Plan

1. Verify sync processes still run without errors
   - Run a manual sync on a database
   - Check logs for any errors
   - Look for "Applied semantic type" messages in the logs

2. Confirm metadata-based classification works
   - Add new fields with names that should trigger semantic type inference
   - Verify they receive the expected semantic types
   - Example: "email" column should receive :type/Email semantic type
   - Example: "created_at" column should receive :type/CreationTimestamp semantic type

3. Confirm no data sampling occurs
   - Check logs for classification messages
   - Monitor database for query activity during sync
   - Verify sync is substantially faster for large tables

4. Verify performance
   - Compare sync times before and after changes
   - Should see significant improvement for large tables

## Future Work

1. Consider a configuration toggle to enable/disable this behavior
2. Implement a more sophisticated approach that allows some fingerprinting that doesn't require data sampling
3. Add telemetry to measure the performance impact of this change

## Notes

This implementation preserves name-based classification while disabling data-based fingerprinting. For a production implementation, you might want to consider:
- Making this configurable per database
- Adding a feature flag to control this behavior
- Preserving some data-based fingerprinting for small tables
